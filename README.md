# nodejs-microservice

This is a practise repo Daniel used to learn node.js. Started from a monolithic repo and separate it to several individual microservices.

1. Service registry service for registering services and service address request;
2. Cache for caching images and text;
3. Rabbit queue for submitting feedbacks.
